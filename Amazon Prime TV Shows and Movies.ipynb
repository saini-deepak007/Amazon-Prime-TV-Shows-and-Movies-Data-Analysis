As competition intensifies, data-driven insights play a crucial role in understanding viewer preferences, content trends, and strategic investment decisions. This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing all shows available on Amazon Prime Video in the United States, offering valuable insights into content diversity, regional availability, audience engagement, and popularity.  \n","\n","One of the primary areas of analysis is **content diversity**, which helps identify the dominant genres and categories on Amazon Prime Video. Streaming platforms aim to provide a wide range of content to appeal to various audience segments, from drama and action to documentaries and reality shows. Understanding which genres dominate the platform can provide insights into viewer preferences and content acquisition strategies. Additionally, analyzing content distribution can highlight whether Amazon Prime focuses more on original productions, licensed content, or niche categories.  \n","\n","Another key aspect of this study is **regional availability**, which examines how content distribution varies across different regions. While this dataset specifically focuses on the United States, similar analyses can be applied to other markets to assess whether Amazon Prime tailors its content strategy based on regional demand. Understanding these distribution patterns can help content creators and streaming platforms make informed decisions about localization, dubbing, and subtitle offerings to attract a wider audience.  \n","\n","The dataset also allows for an analysis of **trends over time**, helping to track how Amazon Prime Video’s content library has evolved. By studying the addition and removal of shows over the years, we can determine whether the platform has increased its focus on certain types of content, such as exclusive originals, international shows, or specific genres. This historical perspective provides insights into Amazon Prime’s content acquisition strategy and how it adapts to changing viewer preferences and market dynamics.  \n","\n","Additionally, **IMDb ratings and popularity** play a crucial role in determining viewer engagement and content success. By analyzing the highest-rated and most popular shows on Amazon Prime Video, this project seeks to identify the factors contributing to high audience ratings and engagement. This analysis can help content creators understand what resonates with viewers, guiding future production and investment decisions. Furthermore, comparing the ratings of Amazon Prime’s original content with licensed shows can offer insights into the platform’s content quality and audience reception.  \n","\n","By leveraging these insights, businesses, content creators, and data analysts can gain a deeper understanding of Amazon Prime Video’s content strategy and its impact on subscription growth and user engagement. The findings from this analysis can support decision-making in areas such as content acquisition, licensing, and original productions. As the streaming landscape continues to evolve, data-driven strategies will be essential in maintaining a competitive edge, attracting new subscribers, and retaining existing ones."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This dataset was created to analyze all shows available on Amazon Prime Video, allowing us to extract valuable insights such as:\n","\n","Content Diversity: What genres and categories dominate the platform?\n","\n","Regional Availability: How does content distribution vary across different regions?\n","\n","Trends Over Time: How has Amazon Prime’s content library evolved?\n","\n","IMDb Ratings & Popularity: What are the highest-rated or most popular shows on the platform?\n","\n","By analyzing this dataset, businesses, content creators, and data analysts can uncover key trends that influence subscription growth, user engagement, and content investment strategies in the streaming industry."],"metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **Define Your Business Objective?**"],"metadata":{"id":"PH-0ReGfmX4f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The business objective of this project is to analyze Amazon Prime Video’s content library to identify trends that drive audience engagement, subscription growth, and strategic content investment.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PhDvGCAqmjP1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **General Guidelines** : -  "],"metadata":{"id":"mDgbUHAGgjLW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
